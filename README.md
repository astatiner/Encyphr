Encyphr is a tool for encryption and decryption of files.

To run it, just clone the repository and open it with IntelliJ and build the application.

Some features I plan on implementing in the coming days-

1. Real time updation of the list present in app as a file is encrypted/decrypted.
2. Giving the user an option to choose from various encryption algorithms.
